# work-day-scheduler

## About this project

The project involves creating a dynamic digital planner that displays the current day at the top and shows timeblocks for standard business hours. These timeblocks are color-coded to differentiate past, present, and future. Users can add events by clicking on a timeblock, which are then saved locally and persist between page refreshes.

### User Story

```
AS an employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

### Built With

- ![HTML]
- ![CSS]
- ![JAVASCRIPT]
- ![JQUERY]
- ![DAYJS]

### Acceptance Criteria

Create a code quiz that contains the following requirements:

- A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
  - Questions contain buttons for each answer.
  - When answer is clicked, the next question appears
  - If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock
- The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.
  - When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score

## Roadmap

They will be added as the pesudocode is made

- [] Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
- [] Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
- [] Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
- [] Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock
- [] Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.
- [] Persist events between refreshes of a page
- [] These roadmap result will look like thepicture below

The following mock-up animation demonstrates the application functionality:

## Important note

a variety of techniques in Javascript are used such as DOM Manipulation, Event Handling, Conditional Logic, Looping, Template Literals, Data Attributes, and Local Storage API.
